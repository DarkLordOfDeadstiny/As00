\maketitle
My take on the algorithm is just to check if the year modulo 4 is equal to 0, and then to make sure a year like 200 do not work for the rule, that it can not be divisible by 100. To support the third rule that anything divisible by 400 is a leap year, an "or" is placed as a secondary condition.
